## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
css properties: Learn how to center divs in the mwiddle of the pages
body {
  display: flex;
  /*makes box movable around the  body*/
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center; /*centers the item to center*/
  min-height: 100vh;



### Continued development

Need to continue progressing on building more dynamic papes. Focusing on how to make a pages looks and respond to every devices.

### Useful resources

- [HMTL elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This helped me search for elements that best suit my page.
- [Layout with Flexbox](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-css/modules/layout-with-flexbox/cheatsheet) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the proper layout with flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
